First of all: thanks for your effort!

## Reporting an issue/proposing new feature

1. If you encounters an issue while working with this package, first of all ensures it's caused by the package itself, not any third-party code or your browser (you can )
2. If the issue is caused by the package, [create a new issue](/../../issues/new) for it, according to the template.
3. If you want to propose new feature instead of reporting an issue, just delete issue's template and write small explanation why you want this feature and why should we implement it.

## Contributing code

1. If you want to contribute code to this package, you should do it via [pull request](/../../pulls).
2. First of all, fork this repository and create `t/<number>` branch, where `<number>` is a number of [an issue](/../../issues) you're going to fix.
3. Write your code and commit to your branch. It would be nice if the commits would adhere to [Conventional Commits standard](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
4. Ensure that everything is working by writing some tests and running them (`npm test`).
5. If you're changing some existing methods or adding new ones, remember about [updating API docs](http://usejsdoc.org/).
6. If everything's working fine, you can create a new pull request and relax, waiting for merge!
